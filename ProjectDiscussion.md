# Project Discussion

The VCF files were visualized to get an idea of the file structures in InterviewDataVisualization.ipynb

The scope of the assignment was completed with the Python script na12878_variant_count.py
	
 * The result given for the number of variants with an allele frequency below 0.01 was 53
	
The script was improved to adjust the input VCF files, allele frequency value, and includes an output CSV with the variants included for the count.
	
 * The improved script is variant_count_export.py
 * An example output with 0.01 allele frequency is filtered_variants.csv
